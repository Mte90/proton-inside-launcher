Are you always tried a way to run quickly, easily without any commands in the terminal a way to execute a Save Editor or a Mod tool for your game on Steam on Linux (or Steam Deck)?

This tool is here for you!

You just need to download the `proton-inside-launcher.sh` file, add the executable permission (Right click->Proprierties) and double click.
You will get 2 window, the first one asking the Steam Game ID and the next one to select the Window executable (or any other executable) that you want to run using the Proton engine with the libraries installed for that game.
On next time you don't need to do that again because a configuration file it will be generated and if found automatically will run the tool.

## Requirements

* kdialog (avalaible on Steam Deck)
* steam
* proton

## Notes

You can set manually the Proton version you want to use modifying the `.sh` file.
